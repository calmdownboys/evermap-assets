# Projects declarations repository for EverMap

See [manifest.json](https://github.com/dima0000bf/evermap-assets/blob/master/manifest.json) for schema details

See [projects/template.yaml](https://github.com/dima0000bf/evermap-assets/blob/master/projects/template.yaml) as an example of declaration.

You also can use an IDE (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) plugin installed) to get better autocompletion.
Or you can add declaration via [web IDE](https://github.dev/dima0000bf/evermap-assets/blob/master/projects) and just use `.json` format! You will get autocompletion by default.

## How to add declaration ?

1. create `.yaml` or `.json` file in `projects/` folder
2. fill your file accordingly to `manifest.json`
3. add path to your declaration in [projects/index.json](https://github.com/dima0000bf/evermap-assets/blob/master/projects/index.json)
4. make a pull request
